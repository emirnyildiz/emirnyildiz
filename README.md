# Hi, I'm Emir! ðŸ‘‹

I was born a civil engineer, I will be a front end developer.


## ðŸš€ About Me
 I graduated from Istanbul University Civil Engineering Department in 2020. In the same year, I started a master's program at YÄ±ldÄ±z Technical University, Department of Construction, as I wanted to improve myself by working on technological activities in the construction sector. During the education period, I tried to take courses in Front-End development. I had the opportunity to improve myself in Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and React. I am also working on learning Angular and TypeScript. I am working on the thesis titled "Mobile Application Design for Construction Site Control and Monitoring Processes" with the thesis advisor, Hande Aladag.
